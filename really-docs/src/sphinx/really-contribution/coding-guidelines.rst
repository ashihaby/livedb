Coding Guidelines
=================

* We are following the standard `Scala Code Style Guidelines <http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/>`_ and we advise that you follow the same style for your code to be accepted. 
* Make sure that you have read/understood everything in  `Scala best practices <https://www.bionicspirit.com/blog/2014/10/20/scala-best-practices.html>`_ article
* `CoffeeScript Style Guide <https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide>`_ for best-practices and coding conventions for the `CoffeeScript <http://coffeescript.org/>`_ programming language.
* To maintain consistent whitespacing styles between different editors and IDEs we are using `EditorConfig <http://editorconfig.org/>`_
