======================

These guidelines are meant to be a living document that should be changed and adapted as needed. We encourage changes that makes it easier to achieve our goals in an efficient way. It is explaining the process for committing code into master. There are of course exceptions to these rules, for example minor changes to comments and documentation, fixing a broken build etc.
